Step 5: Test the program


Problem statement : Accept 2 numbers and perform addition

ans->
Step 1 : Understand the problem statement
we need to conclude that the number are of flost coz its not said in the statement

Step 2: Write the algorithm
START
Accept first number from user and consider it as Nol Accept second number from user and consider it as No2
Create one variable to store the answer as Ans
Perform the addition of Nol and No2
Store the result into Ans
Display the value of Ans as a result|
STOP

Step 3: Deside the programming language
START
Accept first number from user and consider it as Nol Accept second number from user and consider it as No2
Create one variable to store the answer as Ans d
Perform the addition of Nol and No2
Store the result into Ans
Display the value of Ans as a result
